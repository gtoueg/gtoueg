- 👀 I’m interested in history, crime investigation, international human trafficking, numismatics, maps and map study, geography...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on international trafficking of Brazilian babies and children for irregular adoption by foreign couples from the 1980s.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any matter they feel I can be of assistance. I am a journalist by training, curious by nature, self-taught and interested in many topics. Learning is the best of crafts.
